 📍 Based in Brazil  
🎮 I love playing video games in my free time (yes, a true gamer 👾)  
🧪 I currently work as a <strong>Junior QA Analyst</strong>  
 🎓 Studying <strong>Information Systems</strong> (2nd semester)  
 📚 Always eager to learn new things, especially in tech  
 🤝 Open to collaboration and networking!

Since I was a kid, I've always loved everything related to cars — from design and engines to technology and performance. It's one of my biggest passions! 🏎️🔥
